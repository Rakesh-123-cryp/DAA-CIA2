Genetic_Algorithm-Implementation-using-python-class---Tensorflow-like-execution
The Genetic algorithm is applied on ANN with multiple layers. Classes and functions created from scratch using python.

The InputLayer and Dense layers available in Tensorflow is replicated and applied to satisfy the optimization's flow. This is created by a UG graduate and will be updated in the upcoming months to make it more effecient and usable by all

Papers sighted:-

https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-genetic-algorithms-including-example-code-e396e98d8bf3
Accuracy ~ 93% due to the high computation required for the algorithm it takes plenty of time to perform optimization on large dataset. Hence requires massive gpu and cpu to compute



Cultural_Algorithm-Implemented-on-simple-ANN
This code is the implementation of cultural algorithm on simple artificial neural networks. This is performed on bank data available

The papers sighted are listed below :-

https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1508/1508.00468.pdf
Accuracy of the model ~ 95%

CA is also a kind of genetic algorithm with the concept of beliefes that decide how the population improves. This is a self-sustainable population due to the constant change in beliefes togather with the population. Unlike genetic the population need not be fixed and can have variable population. Still produced lesser accuracy than PSO.


Ant_Colony_OPtimization-Applied-on-neural-networks
This code implements ant colony optimisation on artificial neural networks.

The above code was written using the follwing :-

https://scholarworks.calstate.edu/downloads/6395w718d
The accuracy for this method is ~ 89%

Out of the four ant colony is the least effective in this situation. Ant colony can be used for several other places that requires the shortest or the most optimal path is less computation.


PSO-implementation-on-neural-networks
The Particle Swarm analysis is implemented on artificial neural networks

The sites were used for the development of this code:-

https://machinelearningmastery.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-particle-swarm-optimization/
The accuray of this algorithm ~ 97%

The PSO Algorithm has given the best accuracy out of all four algorithms used. This is also computationally less intense on the system
